# Build a simple notion like text editor

Your goal is to recreate what we have outlined in Figma in a live, working prototype, deployed to Heroku or hosted somewhere online for easy access/testing. 

You will be building a Notion-like editor, but only the H1 heading component. So it‚Äôs not much of an editor, but rather an app that lets you write anywhere and convert your content into H1. 

Figma Prototype:  https://www.figma.com/file/tw8CNEl69jYeqPHxfBxf38/Helpjuice-Front-End-Developer-Test-Project?node-id=0%3A1 

If you cannot open the Figma Prototype, we have also attached the images at the end of this document. 

Please note, that the figma prototype is there for you to understand the idea, but not everything (such as editing content) is outlined.  

The prototype should function exactly like in the images.
